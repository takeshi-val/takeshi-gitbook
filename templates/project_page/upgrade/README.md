# Upgrade

<figure><img src="https://github.com/takeshi-val/Logo/raw/main/${PROJECT_NAME}.png" width="150" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Chain ID**: ${CHAIN_ID} | **Latest Version Tag**: ${LATEST_VERSION_TAG} | **Custom Port**: ${CHAIN_PORT}

{% hint style='info' %}
Since we are using Cosmovisor, it makes it very easy to prepare for upcomming upgrade.
You just have to build new binaries and move it into cosmovisor upgrades directory.
{% endhint %}

## Download and build upgrade binaries

```bash
# Clone project repository
cd $HOME
rm -rf ${GIT_DIR}
git clone ${GIT_URL}
cd ${GIT_DIR}
git checkout ${LATEST_VERSION_TAG}

# Build binaries
make build

# Prepare binaries for Cosmovisor
mkdir -p $HOME/${CHAIN_DIR}/cosmovisor/upgrades/${LATEST_VERSION_NAME}/bin
mv ${CHAIN_BINARY_SRC} $HOME/${CHAIN_DIR}/cosmovisor/upgrades/${LATEST_VERSION_NAME}/bin/
rm -rf build
```

*Thats it! Now when upgrade block height is reached, Cosmovisor will handle it automatically!*
